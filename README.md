#  Multiscale Materials ML

> **Author:** Paritosh  
> **Research Area:** Quantum modeling of layered metallic materials + ML for stress/fatigue prediction

##  Project Goal
Build a working simulation + ML pipeline to study how atomic-scale intercalation and layer behavior in metallic composites affect mechanical properties like stress concentration and fatigue behavior.

This project merges:
- Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations
- Feature engineering of material parameters
- Machine learning models to predict real-world mechanical behavior

##  Planned Inclusions

- `ReadingNotes_Fall2025.md`: Key ideas from foundational papers + textbooks (DFT, intercalation, ML for materials)
- `simulation_outputs/`: DFT config files, output logs, convergence plots
- `feature_engineering.ipynb`: First-pass ML features from simulated materials
- `models/`: Jupyter notebooks + scripts for training/testing ML regressors
- `diagrams/`: Visuals showing layer behavior, material interfaces, etc.
- `project_log.md`: Weekly check-ins, goals, results, open questions

##  Why This Matters

Next-gen materials are built from the atom up. This project explores how we can combine **quantum simulations** and **machine learning** to better understand â€” and ultimately design â€” layered materials that resist stress, failure, and fatigue.

Applications include:
-  Battery and electrode materials  
-  Aerospace thermal and mechanical protection  
-  Structural components with long fatigue life

##  Tools & Stack

- Python, NumPy, pandas  
- DFT software (e.g., VASP, Quantum ESPRESSO, GPAW)  
- ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment)  
- Scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebooks  
- Git + GitHub for version control
